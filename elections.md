## Notes
**Owners are tie breakers!**

If an election ends in a tie, the owners are asked who they want to elect. If it continues to be a tie, Head Admins will also be brought in.[^1]

**Owners have the right to overrule an election.**

Now, one owner can't do this, the majority of owners have to agree to overrule an election.
